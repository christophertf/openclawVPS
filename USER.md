# USER.md - About Your Human

_Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go._

- **Name:** Chris
- **What to call them:** Chris
- **Pronouns:** _(unknown)_
- **Timezone:** _(unknown)_
- **Notes:** First connected via Telegram on 2026-02-20. Prefers concise responses that do not end with speculative “next thing” suggestions unless explicitly requested. Prefers 24-hour time format and Celsius for weather/temperature context; uses timestamps heavily for factual sequencing and reality-checking workflows (including CCTV timeline cross-checks). Guiding principle: “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” (favor non-intervention when something is functioning).

## Context

_(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)_

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
