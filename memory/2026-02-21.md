- Chris preference: avoid ending responses with optional future-task suggestions; include only what was asked unless a next step is explicitly requested. Goal is less confusion and less wasted compute/time.

- **Session Summary (OpenClaw setup and auth):**
  - Diagnosed and fixed Telegram connection dropping due to Antigravity fallback errors. Switched the `openclaw.json` primary model to `openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex`.
  - Confirmed Workspace and CLAW functionality by creating `secret_test.txt`, which CLAW successfully read and reported via Telegram.
  - Instituted a firm synchronization protocol between Antigravity and CLAW to avoid out-of-band edit discrepancies.
    - Created `memory/PRE-FLIGHT-SYNC.md` checklist.
    - Created `memory/change-feed.log`.
    - Linked the workspace to the GitHub remote `christophertf/openclawVPS`.
    - Added pre-commit hook `.githooks/pre-commit` requiring all commits on non-main branches to log their changes in `change-feed.log`.
    - Enforced branch protection to block direct local commits on `main`.
    - Configured Git authorship so native CLAW commits appear cleanly separated from Antigravity edits.

- **Wrap-up Verification (final check pass):**
  - Confirmed active runtime model/auth: `openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex` via OAuth.
  - Confirmed workspace git is clean and remote origin is correctly set.
  - Ran `scripts/preflight.sh`: branch/status/change-feed checks passed.
  - Ran `scripts/sync.sh`: switched safely to `main`, fetched/pulled cleanly, no drift.
  - Re-validated `.githooks/pre-commit` protections:
    - blocks direct commits on local `main`
    - requires `memory/change-feed.log` for significant commits
  - Prior stage is closed with controls active and verified.
- Chris preference update: use 24-hour time and Celsius by default; timestamps are critical for sequencing/fact-checking (CCTV-assisted).
- Deferred task: move Whisper transcription from API to local/offline hardware path to reduce API costs.
- Session wrap: initial stock-skill pass completed with Chris (weather, healthcheck, image-gen confirmed; whisper + skill-creator practical execution intentionally deferred). Discovered a larger stock capability map (`STOCK-CAPABILITY-MAP.md`) to tackle in a future session.
- Chris principle: 'if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it' — prefer ignoring non-blocking churn and moving on.
- Discord setup completed additively (Telegram preserved): bot app created/invited, token configured, gateway probe confirmed Discord running/works, guild allowlist policy configured, and in-server channel messaging validated (`#bot-test`). Discord DM remained blocked by platform privacy/routing behavior and was intentionally left as-is to keep Telegram DM as the main private lane while Discord channels serve as isolated topic contexts.
